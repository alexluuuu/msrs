## MSRS Repository

Here we'll try to track some of the scripts that we use to automate MSRS. Student data, rankings, and other information will not be pushed to the repository.

## Workflow

1. Given the excel or csv that contains the judging information, and the list of student abstract submissions, use `abstract_sort.py` to automatically assign abstracts -> judges. 

2. Use a word doc mail merge -> generate a pdf where each page contains the abstracts, where the order of the pages is the same as the order of the index list.
